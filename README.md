# Do not use

This was initially split out from IdentityPython/SATOSA repository in order to 
decouple the micro-services from the core of SATOSA. This is not ready yet, but 
plans are there to make it happen. Until then this only causes problems as part 
of the core code depends on microservices, and the code is duplicated. Use the
SATOSA repository directly, until the new-style micro-services are in place.

Changes that took place in this repository should be in place and updated with
the latest changes on the SATOSA repository.
